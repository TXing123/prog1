     The wwhhiicchh utility takes a list of command names and searches the path for
     each executable file that would be run had these commands actually been
     invoked.

     The following options are available:

     --aa      List all instances of executables found (instead of just the
             first one of each).

     --ss      No output, just return 0 if any of the executables are found, or
             1 if none are found.

     Some shells may provide a builtin wwhhiicchh command which is similar or iden-
     tical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.
